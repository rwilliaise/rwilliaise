## Hello!
Welcome to my profile! :wave:

### Things I've Made
I've made some things over the years, primarily in Java and TypeScript.

#### Schmucks
A mod for Minecraft that adds little people that serve you.

#### Genesis
A Minecraft plugin and Discord bot combo that allow you to
1. Invite a bot
2. Run a command on the Discord server, gives you a code
3. Run a command from your Minecraft Server with that code
4. All messages from both sides show up on opposite sides now
5. It saves if you logged into the bot

#### Everything else
I have a lot of private repos, primarily because I like how portable I can be with Github. I'll eventually public some of them, but most will never see the light of day.
